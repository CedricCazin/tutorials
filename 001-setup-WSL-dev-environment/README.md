# Setup a WSL dev environment

## Prerequisites

You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11.

## Why

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets you run a Linux environment, including command-line tools and applications, directly on Windows, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual boot setup.

WSL especially helps web developers and those working with Bash and Linux-first tools (for example, Ruby and Python) to use their tools on Windows and ensure consistency between development and production environments.

There is 2 version of WSL, it is recommanded to use WSL 2:

* WSL 2 install a linux kernel inside a managed virtual machine (through a subset of Hyper-V features) that implements the full Linux kernel.
* WSL 1 had lot of performance issue because not all syscalls were implemented

## Install and configure Windows tools

* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Optional but highly recommended:

* Windows Terminal \
